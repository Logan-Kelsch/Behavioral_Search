### PERSISTENCE FOLDER INFO: ###

This folder is for temporary usage of long term storage in fully automated algorithm executions. <br>
Currently (Logan Kelsch - 5/27/25) I am only planning on utilizing my personal computer, containing: 

- 16GB DDR4 RAM
- i5 14th GEN CPU
- NVIDIA GTX 1070ti
- 500GB SSD

With my prior experience with genetic algorithms and data of this size on this amount of ram, <br>
short-term memory efficiency in this program with be top priority when moving towards automation, <br>
and variables will likely need to be moved out of short-term storage to avoid crashes from memory overload.
