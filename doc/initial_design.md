### General order of development for this research

- 1 collect data, multiple indices and time frames
- 2 create initial set of features
- 3 create distribution detection and association functionality
- 4 create utility functionality for referencing feats (prior ex: fss)
- 5 create state generation algorithm from any feature set by considering distributions
- 6 create proof of concept for NN with initializable variables for random generation
- 7 create proof of concept for MDP with initializable variables for random generation
- 8 create proof of concept for HMM with initializable variables for random generation
- 9 Implement variable-node structure for pattern based gene (node)
- 10 Implement variable-node structure for NN/HMM/MDP full implementation for random generation
- 11 Implement capacity for node ('gene') to translate between node-type ('genome'),
  - 11.1 AKA. ensure universal congruency between random parameterization and feature perception, where unique node-based analytical approach is on the top of procedural stack.
- 12 implement gene + population serialization/deserialization
- 13 create custom population generation functions
- 14 explore segment entry exit theory
- 15 create differentiation in segment entry and exit
- 16 potentially explore segment optimization or solution space exploring
- 17 consider forbidden areas of solution space to be directly associated with exit conditioning
- 18 optimize all functionality
- 19 implement monte carlo and walk forward evaluation
- 20 create one click functions for visualization of results or dynamics of search
- 21 create results compilation functionality for easy visualization
- 22 execute large scale searches and compile findings
